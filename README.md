various utility classes - but for **Pimcore**.

# When should I use this bundle?
Whenever you create a project using Pimcore.

# Why should I use this bundle?
This bundle provides a nice and clean way to create translation-keys from constants and some default implementations
(e.g., for `Areabrick`s).
