# Pimcore Utilities
When using Pimcore, chances are that the default implementation of some functionality doesn't quite suit your needs. This
can have many reasons, with the most common one being legacy code that is still around for compatibility reasons. Additionally,
sometimes a feature is missing completely.

This bundle aims to tackle these problems, by providing more suitable default implementations and adding some functionality.
